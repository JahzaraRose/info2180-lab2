        <p> Welcome to my blog! I’m Jahzara, I’m 19 years of age currently diving deep into the fascinating world of computer science and Digital Media. My journey in this field has been filled with learning, exploration, and an endless curiosity for technology and innovation. </p>
        <p> When I’m not coding or debugging, you can find me enjoying my pescatarian lifestyle, experimenting with delicious seafood recipes, or indulging in my guilty pleasures—Sour Patch Kids and a very cold Ting. I have a love for animals, traveling, and the ocean, which inspire me to appreciate the beauty and complexity of the world around us.</p>
        <p> I created this blog to share my insights, experiences, and discoveries in both computer science and life. Whether you’re a fellow tech enthusiast or just here for some sweet treats, I hope you find something that resonates with you.</p>
        <p> Let’s embark on this journey together!</p>

        <h2>My Journey in Computer Science</h2>

        <p>As a computer science major, I often get asked what drew me to this field. The truth is, the money, from a young age I've watched my uncle thrive in this field allowing him to now live that stable lifestyle we all dream for. Despite that I found technology fascinating with how it shapes our world. From creating my first website to diving into algorithms and data structures,with each exhilarating step I actually found my passion.</p> 
        <p>One of the things I love most about coding is the problem-solving aspect. Every line of code is a challenge waiting to be tackled. Whether I’m debugging an error or optimizing a program, I find immense satisfaction in finding solutions. It’s like solving a puzzle, and each piece fits together to create something functional and meaningful. Don't get me wrong it is very frustrating when a piece that should fit doesn't. What  I hate the most is the fact that there is always a due date haunting me.</p> 
        <p>Hence, In future posts, I’ll be sharing tips for fellow students, project highlights, and my thoughts on emerging technologies like AI.  </p>
